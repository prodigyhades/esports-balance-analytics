## Overview

**Esports Balance Analytics** is a research-driven project that leverages **granular round-by-round 2025 VCT (Valorant Champions Tour)** data to build a **Round Win Probability Model**.

The model aims to **quantify each agent’s true impact on winning**, controlling for factors such as team economy, map side, and agent synergies.

This data-driven approach enables evidence-based insights into whether agents are **overperforming (requiring a nerf)** or **underperforming (requiring a buff)** — with **statistical precision** rather than subjective judgment.

---

## Key Focus Areas

1. **True Agent Impact:** Measuring how much an agent’s presence contributes to round wins — moving beyond basic stats like K/D.  
2. **Cross-Role Performance:** Identifying agents outperforming their intended role (e.g., Sentinels outperforming Duelists).  
3. **Agent Synergies:** Analyzing win probabilities for specific agent combinations to detect overpowered pairings.  
4. **Patch Impact:** Quantifying how patches affect agent balance and team performance metrics.

---

## Current Focus

- Building a **round-level probabilistic model** using historical match data  
- Integrating **agent, economy, and map variables** into the prediction pipeline  
- Experimenting with **Bayesian and ensemble-based approaches** for model stability
